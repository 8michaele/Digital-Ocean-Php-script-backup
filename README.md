# Digital-Ocean-PHP-script-backup
Simple PHP script to snapshot droplets daily and weekly.

**How it works?**

The script simply snapshots the droplets daily and delete the old ones except for the Friday backup.
This means that Friday backups are kept unless they are 7 days older.

**How to implement?**

All you need to do is:

1- Change the token in token function.

2- Run a daily cronjob.

3- That's all.
